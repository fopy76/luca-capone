# Project Brief: Luca's Personal Website - The Gen X AI Builder's Digital HubProject Brief

# Executive Summary

This project aims to create a minimalist personal website for Luca, a Gen X creative professional who is leveraging AI to build digital products without traditional technical expertise. The website will serve as his primary digital hub, showcasing his product portfolio (including Vibe Coding), building his personal brand as a non-technical AI entrepreneur, and establishing his credibility as someone who ships products rather than teaches. The site will embody the principle that AI has democratized creation, making age and technical background irrelevant to building successful digital products.

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

- Luca has a portfolio of ideas and is actively building AI-powered products but lacks a central digital presence
- As a Gen X professional without coding background, he represents an underserved demographic in tech entrepreneurship
- There's no unified platform to showcase his products, share his journey, and build his audience
- Potential customers and followers have no clear way to discover his work or connect with him

### Business Need

Create a strategic digital hub that:

1. Positions Luca as a successful non-technical founder who ships products
2. Showcases his product portfolio professionally
3. Builds an engaged audience through newsletter subscriptions
4. Establishes credibility without relying on teaching or tutorials
5. Serves as the foundation for his transition to full-time entrepreneurship

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Establish Digital Authority**: Create a professional web presence that positions Luca as a credible AI entrepreneur despite being non-technical
2. **Product Showcase**: Build a portfolio section that effectively displays current products, works-in-progress, and future projects
3. **Audience Building**: Implement newsletter infrastructure to build a direct communication channel with followers
4. **Brand Differentiation**: Leverage the "Gen X non-technical founder" angle as a unique selling proposition

### Secondary Objectives

1. Create a scalable platform that can grow with additional products
2. Establish consistent branding across all digital touchpoints
3. Build social proof through metrics and progress documentation
4. Generate leads for beta testing and early adoption

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- **Aspiring Non-Technical Entrepreneurs (35-55 years)**: Professionals who have ideas but feel limited by lack of technical skills
- **Gen X Creatives**: People who thought they "missed their window" in tech
- **AI-Curious Professionals**: Those interested in leveraging AI but intimidated by the technical barrier

### Secondary Audience

- **Early Adopters**: People interested in trying new AI-powered tools
- **Fellow Indie Makers**: The broader solopreneur community
- **Potential Collaborators**: Designers, marketers, and other non-technical professionals

## Unique Value Proposition

"Proving that age and technical expertise are no longer barriers to building successful digital products in the AI era."

### Key Differentiators

1. **The Anti-Guru**: Ships products instead of selling courses
2. **Age as an Asset**: 25+ years of business experience applied to AI entrepreneurship
3. **Relatable Journey**: Transparent documentation without teaching
4. **Results Over Methods**: Focus on what's built, not how it's built

## Technical Considerations

### Confirmed Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Newsletter**: Substack (free tier) with migration path to ConvertKit
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics (free tier) or Plausible
- **Development Tools**: v0.dev for initial generation, Cursor for refinement, Claude Code for complex tasks

### Design Principles

- Maximum 3 colors (white, black, one accent)
- System fonts or clean sans-serif
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Expandable sections for detailed content

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- Limited technical expertise (must be maintainable by non-developer)
- Budget considerations (lean startup approach)
- Time availability (building while maintaining day job)

### Assumptions

- Vibe Coding will be ready for beta within project timeline
- Email list building is primary conversion goal
- Minimalist design resonates with target audience
- "Build in public" approach without teaching is viable
- AI tools (v0, Cursor, Claude Code) will enable efficient development

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
